                The model is used to simulate the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in spatially and age-structured populations and was developed to simulate Mtb transmission. The population of individuals simulated by the model is designed based on demographics and initial state structure, and then a network of links between individuals is established. After establishing the population, the model iterates over unit discrete time steps (e.g., one week) to simulate the spread of Mtb in the population. Our model requires several rate parameters to describe the rate at which infected individuals transition between disease states (see 'Rate parameters of status transformation')

                At the beginning of each time step, our model will update the disease status of the infected individual based on the transition probabilities inferred from these ratios, and then calculate, based on the relevant formula (see 'Probability of status transformation'), the transition of the susceptible individual from disease state m to the the probability of disease state n. Ultimately, the probability of infection of a susceptible individual (studying at school or working in a workplace) when in contact with an infected individual (i.e., an individual in a subclinical or clinical disease state) can be calculated for each unit time step.

                        Suzhou will be the site of a large biopharmaceutical ecosystem, featuring leading global pharmaceutical companies, premier healthcare providers, and world-class academic forums. The goal is to build, within 10 years, a Pharma Valley of China – a globally recognised, influential and best-in-class industry landmark in China. It is under this strategic background that Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Suzhou Industrial Park government co-founded the XJTLU Wisdom Lake Academy of Pharmacy on 11 November 2020. In addition to the university-industry partnership, the Academy of Pharmacy added the notion of society to create a society-university-industry ecosystem, as an innovative and practice-based exploration of the national strategy. The University is able to take advantage of its multi-disciplinary expertise and global connectivity in building an academically rigorous Academy of Pharmacy that is uniquely positioned to train high-quality, internationally minded talents. Consequently, the Academy was proposed as part of the plan to execute this strategy. Recognised as the catalyst and enabler for building a first-rate and sustainable society-university-industry ecosystem, the Academy has reached full agreement with other parties in the ecosystem, and endeavours to help transform Suzhou into a world-class biopharmaceutical and healthcare hub by aligning its strategic positioning with the goal of the Pharma Valley of China.
